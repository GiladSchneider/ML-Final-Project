# ML-Final-Project

- This is my final project submission for my Machine Learning class. 
- The task was to use two different Machine Learning techniques to fill in the 300 by 300 blacked-out portion in the center of the following images:

- I implemented a neural network class and decision tree class from scratch, including gradient descent, backpropagation, correlation calculation, and highest expected information calculation algorithms.
- Then, I trained an ensemble of Neural Networks to iteratively predict each pixel in the masked image and leveraged Bootstrapping by using past outputs to make future outputs.
- I employed a similar technique for the decision tree model.
